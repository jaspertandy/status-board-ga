# Installation

To install, see the detailed instructions at [Google Analytics for Status Board](http://www.hiltmon.com/blog/2013/04/10/google-analytics-for-status-board/).

You will need a copy of [Status Board](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fstatus-board%252Fid449955536%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30), a [DropBox](http://www.dropbox.com) account and some Ruby-fu to make this all work.

Quick install:

Install the `json` gem:

	$ sudo gem install json

Build and install the `gattica` gem:

	$ git clone git://github.com/chrisle/gattica.git
	$ cd gattica/
	$ bundle install
	$ gem build gattica.gemspec
	$ sudo gem install gattica-0.6.2.gem
	
Update each script, replacing **email**, **password**, **title**, **file_name** and **dropbox_path**. Test run each to see that they work.

Share the files on Dropbox and email the links to your device.

Schedule the scripts to run by modifying the sample `.plists` for `launchd` or create a `crontab` entry. Then:

	$ cp com.hiltmon.status_board_ga.plist ~/Library/LaunchAgents
	$ launchctl load -w ~/Library/LaunchAgents/com.hiltmon.status_board_ga.plist

Add the linked files as graphs or tables in [Status Board](http://click.linksynergy.com/fs-bin/stat?id=V41G*FiMqjc&offerid=146261&type=3&subid=0&tmpid=1826&RD_PARM1=https%253A%252F%252Fitunes.apple.com%252Fus%252Fapp%252Fstatus-board%252Fid449955536%253Fmt%253D8%2526uo%253D4%2526partnerId%253D30)

## Config

Everything is configured by `config.yaml`. Add in your GMail username and password. Each type of report is also configure here. The `file` variable should be used without extension, as the appropriate one is added automatically. `dir` should be full and absolute when running by a cron. If you only have one profile in your analytics account, you can remove `profile` entirely. Leaving any trace of the variable will probably cause this to fail, currently.
